Start with modeling the agency. 

Displaying information can come later. And it probably won't even be that hard. Start with the agency. 

Create an agency by giving it a name and a data retrieval method. 

It's not clear to me yet whether the data retrieval is part of the model or the view. 

Agency.routes
Agency.localRoutes
Agency.stops
Agency.localStops
Agency.alerts
Agency.localDepartures

route (or a "service?")
stop
departure
alert
